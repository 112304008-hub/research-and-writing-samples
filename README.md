## 1. “SAY NO TO APPEARANCE ANXIETY”

**Language:** English  
**Type:** Individual research report  
**Methods:** Online questionnaire (Google Form), basic descriptive statistics  
**Topic:** Causes, manifestations, and coping strategies related to appearance anxiety

### 1.1 Overview

This report investigates the causes and impact of appearance anxiety in modern society, especially among young people who are active on social media.

The paper:

- Defines appearance anxiety and summarizes related literature (social comparison, media influence, self-esteem, perfectionism).
- Explores how beauty standards, personal growth experiences (e.g., bullying, unfair treatment based on looks), and psychological factors together shape individuals’ self-perception.
- Distinguishes between **anxiety-related behaviors** (e.g., excessive comparison, avoidance, over-focusing on appearance) and **coping strategies** (e.g., make-up, clothing, self-affirmation, inner growth).

### 1.2 Research Design

- **Instrument:** Online questionnaire (Google Form)  
- **Period:** Two weeks  
- **Sample:** 50+ respondents

The questionnaire covers:

- Demographics and the perceived importance of appearance  
- Frequency and triggers of appearance anxiety  
- Daily behaviors linked to appearance concerns  
- Coping behaviors and what respondents consider “effective” in practice  

### 1.3 Key Findings

- Many respondents rate appearance as an important or very important factor in their lives.  
- Common anxiety-related behaviors include:
  - Repeatedly comparing oneself with others (online and offline)  
  - Over-focusing on specific physical features  
  - Avoiding certain social situations or activities due to appearance concerns  

- Coping strategies fall into two broad categories:
  - **Appearance-focused**: make-up, clothing, accessories, weight control, skincare  
  - **Psychological**: self-affirmation, avoiding comparison, cultivating intrinsic value and skills, relaxation and stress reduction  

Respondents generally perceive **developing inner value and self-confidence** as a more sustainable way to reduce appearance anxiety, compared with purely appearance-focused strategies.

### 1.4 Implications

The report suggests that:

- Individuals can benefit from shifting attention from external appearance to internal growth and competence.
- Beauty, wellness, and mental health-related industries can design more targeted products and services by recognizing different types of appearance anxiety and differentiated needs revealed in the survey.

## 2. “Economic Analysis of Ticket Scalping”

**Language:** English  
**Type:** Group coursework (CLEAR assignment)  
**Topic:** Ticket scalping as a secondary market under fixed supply and regulated prices

### 2.1 Overview

This piece analyzes concert ticket scalping as a visible, everyday example of a black market.  
The work uses ticket resale markets to illustrate how basic microeconomic concepts operate in a familiar real-world setting.

The report:

- Describes how official ticket prices are often set below equilibrium, while the number of seats is fixed by venue capacity.
- Explains why scarcity and unmet demand naturally give rise to a secondary market where prices are higher.
- Applies **supply–demand analysis** and **price elasticity of demand and supply** to explain how scalpers can charge substantial premiums.

### 2.2 Key Economic Insights

- When official prices are kept low and quantities are fixed, excess demand emerges and creates room for scalpers to profit.
- The supply of tickets in the scalper market is highly inelastic (total number of tickets cannot be easily increased), which supports higher resale prices.
- When information is imperfect and competition is limited, tickets may not be allocated efficiently—tickets go to those most willing or able to pay scalpers, not necessarily those who value the event the most.
- The reflection links these ideas to other real-world examples, such as post-disaster price spikes in basic goods, where supply shocks and elasticity are also critical.

### 2.3 Reflection and Use of Feedback

The assignment includes a short response letter that:

- Explains how the group revised the structure to stay within word limits while improving clarity.
- Describes how explanations of elasticity and supply–demand were rewritten to reflect a deeper understanding of the concepts.
- Documents limited and transparent use of AI tools (e.g., grammar checking and conceptual clarification) as part of the writing process.
